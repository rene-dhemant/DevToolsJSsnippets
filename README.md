**Accidentally won 🥇 place in the [SEO Tech Tip Competition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rene-dhemant_techseosummit-activity-7242119982711472128-lrB6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) last night.**

Actually, it must be a challenge cup because it was a 50/50 tie with [Roxana Stingu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roxana-stingu/). She very cleverly gave me the lead and “demanded” all my handcrafted .JS snippets in return in front of the voting audience. **Well played. And of course I will deliver.** 🤝

But honestly: Every "6 minute" SEO Tech Tip was marvelous!
